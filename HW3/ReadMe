1. Table and plot are in ipynb file (table also can be accessed via txt file), to compile it I suggest using attached sh file, but it will took some time (the step in increasing of string length is moderate). Program supposingly works as intended, but for some reason bandwidth drops randomly shortly from the start, and I do not understand why. I checked multiple combinations of MPI built-in functions, but this is probably not the case. Also when this "error" occurs, tabulation in certain place of output file changes (shifts), but python sees this invisible tabulation sign anyway. Maybe appending to file is malfunctioning.  

2. To obtain result and see the picture please compile it in a way "./name_of programm rule(int<256) width(basically size, I recommend smth like 32)"
