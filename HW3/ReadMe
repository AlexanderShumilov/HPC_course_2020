#### 1. hw3.sh, Ping_pong.c, Table.txt, Ping_pong.ipynb, pp, log.txt
Table and plot are in ipynb file (table also can be accessed via txt file), to compile it I suggest using attached sh file, but it will took some time (the step in increasing of string length is moderate). Program supposingly works as intended, but for some reason bandwidth drops not randomly (15-th iteration) shortly from the start, and I do not understand why. I checked multiple combinations of MPI built-in functions, but this is probably not the case. Also when this "error" occurs, tabulation in certain place of output file changes (shifts), but python sees this invisible tabulation sign anyway. Maybe appending to file is malfunctioning.  
Suggestion - start with bigger initial length)). If you want to test my programm probably you'll want to increase the step - it can be done manually in code (I commented where).

#### 2. cell.c, cell_mpi.c, cell
To obtain result and see the picture please compile it in a way "./name_of programm rule(int<256) width(basically size, I recommend smth like 32)".
Example: ./cell 184 32
Predefined rules are 110, 184, 43 - if you will use this combinations you will get particular pictures with particular initial conditions, otherwise everything will be randomized! Nevertheless you will see all conditions after programm will be run.
I didn't implement "проверка на дурачка" (term for testing program with obviously wrong arguments), so you will get bad errors if input will be incorrect (this is purely technical and not the global aim of task).
